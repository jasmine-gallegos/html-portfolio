<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! My name is Jay. I grew up in San Francisco, California. I attended Ruth
  Asawa School of the Arts for Theatre. I am currently a Computer Science
  student at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. My concentration is
  Software Engineering, but at the moment I am also learning web development in
  my own time. I want to go into the tech industry to create easily useable and
  understandable technology for everyone. I love helping others and can easily
  teach when I understand the material. I am currently a member of Upsilon Pi
  Epsilon, an academic computing fraternity, and a part of the event commitee.
